# Time-Series-Analysis-
Google Trends Time Series Analysis 

- The goal of this project was to assess and better understand the driving factors behind Google search interest for Home Depot.
- I chose to explore Home Depot, on the assumption that seasonality and weather patterns may play an active role, and may be ultimately predictable.
- Established time series model and observed the overall trend and whether the search interest for the brand is steadily growing or not. 
- Illustrated a seasonality model  to observe if the seasonality was driven by the product or consumers.
- I have created a forecast for the next calendar year using facebook's prophet forecasting tool and performed error analysis to quantify the model. 
- Next, I have used the ad spend data exported for Home Depot. Before using the expenditure time series as predictors I have tested the stationarity of the data via ADF test.
